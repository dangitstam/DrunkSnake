# DrunkSnake

An inebriated twist of a well-known classic. Players control a snake that grows in length as it collects beer mugs, and whose movement becomes increasingly more sporadic.

Collect coffee as blood-alcohol level rises too quickly, and try to collect as many mugs as you can!

Written with Pygame http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html

## To run DrunkSnake via terminal:
First, navigate to DrunkSnake directory and activate the environment that includes Pygame:
`source DrunkSnakeEnv/bin/activate`

Next, run the game using python 2:
`python2 DrunkSnake.py`

## How to play:
Mugs of beer get you points! Collect as many as you can. Note that as your snake gets drunker (or more drunk?), your snake's vision gets blurry and its movements more unpredictable.

When your blood alcohol level drops too low, espresso appears! Use them to help yourself sober up.
